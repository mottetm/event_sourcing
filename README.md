# Postgresql event sourcing

Small sql scripts to set up an event sourcing model in a postgresql database.

The model can be set up using `extensions_setup.sql` and `sourcing_setup.sql`.

An exemple is provided with a single user table. Use `user_setup.sql` to create the table and `user_test.sql` for some event examples.
